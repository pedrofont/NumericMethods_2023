# NumericMethods_2023
## Code used in Numeric Methods course at EPGE


These folders contain my solution attempts for the Numeric Methods course problem sets, which I took in the first quarter of 2023.

## A note for future students...
You can take my code as reference if you come to find them helpful, but I strongly recommend you to try coming up with your own functions and code.
Also, my codes likely have mistakes which I couldn't fix due to time constraints.

## 1st PS (Discretization methods)
The first problem set deals with discretization of an AR(1) process using both Tauchen (1986) and Rouwenhorst's (1995) methods.

## 2nd PS (VFI methods)
This second problem set deals with applying different tricks to speed up Value Function Interation routines in a stochastic RBC model economy.

## 3rd PS (Projection methods)
On the third problem set I was asked to solve a RBC model using different projection methods, including global projection (Chebyshev polynomials and collocation) and finite elements (Galerkin and collocation).

## 4th PS (Heterogeneous Agents)
The final problem set asked us to numerically solve a heterogenous-agent stochastic model.
